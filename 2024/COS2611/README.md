## Linked list
 * [Linked list Tutorial 01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKfj0l7ndbc)
 * [Linked list Tutorial 02 - Insert an element to linked list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNMIDj62o_o)

 * Arrays have fixed side but linked list is dynamic.
 * Random access is not allowed, because you don't know where the next element is. you only know the 1st element, then first element will point you to the next element.
 * Linked list need more memory compared to array, because it store 2 things, pointer and value.
### 3. Linked lists
#### 3.1. Linked lists
      * Differences between arrays and linked list:
	    * Arrays:
		  * Defined size
		  * Insertion and deletion of elements are difficult 
		  * Accessing the elements is permitted at random 
		  * Elements are contiguous
		  * No additional space is required for the pointer to the next element
		  
		* Linked lists
		  * Size is variable
		  * Insertion and deletion of elements are simpler
		  * No random access to the elements is possible
		  * Elements are not contiguous
		  * A pointer is required and requires additional memory
